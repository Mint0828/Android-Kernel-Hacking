## [SJTU CS307 & CS356 Course](http://cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~fwu/teaching/cs307.html)
## Project 1
- Implement a system call that uncovers the current process tree
- Write a program that creates another process that invokes the system call, uncovering the relationship between the two processes
- Solve the synchronization problem in *Burger Buddies Problem* using mutex and semaphores
## Project 2
- Implement a system call that uncovers the mapping of a target process's pages (from virtual address to physical address)
- Implement a system call that copies a target process's 2-level page tables to a pre-allocated area of memory
- Implement a new page replacement algorithm for Android kernel and replace the original one with it
